## **Artificial Intelligence in Education**

### **Role in the Classroom**
Everyone who has kept up with recent news should be aware of artificial intelligence. Most students have heard of and used ChatGPT. These tools have completely changed how people approach their work and studies. AI has become a powerful tool that can be used to improve the quality of education. It can be used by students to improve their learning experience and by teachers to improve their teaching experience.

### **My Personal Use of AI**
There has not been a single assignment from this semester where I have not used artificial intelligence in some way (don't tell my professors). Weighing the pros and cons, the productivity advantages that AI offers doesn't make sense to ignore.

There have been three main large language models (LLMs) that I have leveraged to get the most out of my time and energy.

**LLMs used:**
- OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 models
- Google's Bard model
- Microsoft's Bing Chat model

### **Experience in 314**

1. **Experience WODs**
    - Experience WODs were where I did the most learning. Through these assignments I became familiar with the lower level syntax of JavaScript and the concepts of web development with React components. I only used AI if the videos were not able to answer my questions.

2. **In-class Practice WODs**
    - For in-class practice WODs, I used a very minimal amount of AI. I wanted to make sure I was able to put what I learned into practice.

3. **In-class WODs**
    - Prior to the graded WODs, I would have done enough practice to understand the material. When it is time to put what I learned into practice, I used ChatGPT to create templates or finish code blocks that would have taken me a long time to develop.

4. **Essays**
    - When writing essays, I used ChatGPT to create the Markdown templates for me to then fill in using IntelliJ. I also used it to help come up with ideas and fix any grammatical errors.

5. **Final Project**
    - I used ChatGPT to create most of the layouts and file structure for our final project. Many of the tools we are introducing were not covered in class so ChatGPT was a great way to get a head start on the project.

6. **Learning a Concept / Tutorial**
    - For learning new concepts or following tutorials, AI models like ChatGPT were instrumental. They provided clear explanations and step-by-step guides, especially for complex topics in web development and JavaScript nuances that were not covered extensively in our course materials.

7. **Answering a Question in Class or in Discord**
    - AI assisted me in promptly responding to queries on class Discord channels. Whether it was a conceptual doubt or a specific coding issue, I could quickly consult the AI for accurate and concise answers, enhancing the collaborative learning experience.

8. **Asking or Answering a Smart-Question**
    - In the process of formulating or responding to smart-questions, AI tools were a great resource. They helped me structure my questions more effectively and provided comprehensive answers that often included multiple perspectives or solutions.

9. **Coding Example (e.g., "give an example of using Underscore .pluck")**
    - For coding examples, such as using the Underscore library's `.pluck` method, AI tools provided quick and efficient code snippets. These examples not only saved time but also helped in understanding the practical application of various library functions.

10. **Explaining Code**
    - AI was particularly helpful in explaining code segments. Whenever I encountered a block of code I didn't understand, the AI could dissect it and explain each part in simple terms, significantly aiding my learning process.

11. **Writing Code**
    - While writing code, AI tools served as an excellent reference point. They suggested efficient coding practices and algorithms, which I could adapt and integrate into my assignments, improving both the quality and efficiency of my coding.

12. **Documenting Code**
    - For documentation, AI models were invaluable in providing clear and concise comments and explanations. This not only made my code more understandable but also taught me the best practices in code documentation.


#### **Quality Assurance (e.g., "Whatâ€™s wrong with this code" or "Fix the ESLint errors in")**
- In quality assurance tasks, AI was a reliable assistant. It quickly identified errors or potential improvements in my code and offered suggestions to fix them, ensuring higher standards of code quality.

#### **Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed**
- Beyond these specific tasks, AI was a versatile tool in various other aspects of the course. From brainstorming project ideas to optimizing workflows and understanding advanced concepts, the breadth of its utility was truly remarkable.

### **Section III: Ethical Considerations**

The ethical implications of using AI in academic settings cannot be overlooked. There are concerns regarding the originality of work, dependency on technology, and potential misuse of AI for dishonest purposes. It's important to navigate these issues responsibly, ensuring that AI is used as a supplement to one's own efforts rather than a replacement.

#### **Originality and Academic Integrity**
- AI can generate content that may blur the lines of academic integrity. I always made sure to use AI as a tool for assistance and inspiration, rather than directly submitting AI-generated work.

#### **Dependence on Technology**
- While AI significantly boosts productivity, there's a risk of becoming overly dependent on it. I aimed to strike a balance, using AI to enhance my understanding but not to replace the learning process.

#### **Responsible Use**
- Responsible use of AI is crucial. I adhered to ethical guidelines and course policies, ensuring that my use of AI was transparent and within the bounds of academic honesty.

### **Section IV: Future Prospects**

Looking ahead, the role of AI in education seems to be expanding. AI has the potential to personalize learning experiences, provide adaptive resources, and even assist in administrative tasks. However, the challenge will be to integrate AI in a way that enriches education while preserving the core values of academic integrity and personal development.

#### **Personalized Learning**
- AI can tailor educational content to individual learning styles and paces, promising a more effective and engaging learning experience.

#### **Resource Optimization**
- AI can help optimize educational resources, from curriculum design to feedback mechanisms, making education more efficient and accessible.

#### **Administrative Assistance**
- Beyond academic support, AI can streamline administrative tasks, allowing educators to focus more on teaching and less on bureaucracy.

### **Conclusion**

In conclusion, my experience with AI in education has been profoundly transformative. While AI offers immense benefits in terms of efficiency and resource optimization, it's imperative to use it responsibly and ethically. As we move forward, AI's role in education will likely grow, but it should always be viewed as a tool to enhance, not replace, the human element in learning. The future of AI in education is bright, and it promises to revolutionize the way we learn, teach, and interact with information.
