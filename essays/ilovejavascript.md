*Javascript: my thoughts and opinions.*

For most of my life, I have been using computers to entertain and educate myself. It wasn't until I started middle school when I realized that there were people who actually wrote every single feature that I used on the internet. My first programming language was Java and I thought that it was a good language to start with. Java feels like a step above C++ in terms of its object oriented nature, while still maintaining a lot of the core ideas that originated in C. 

After learning to use many other languages, Javascript seemed very interesting due to its explosive popularity in the software engineering industry. 

## In comparison to other languages

I think Javascript is very unique compared to most languages. Not because of the language itself, but because of the the community of its users and developers. Due to the large userbase of the language, there is an enormous amount of resources for new programmers who want to learn how to use Javascript. 

## Should newbies learn Javascript first?

Javascript is a pretty cool language to use. It is extremely versitile and fun to build with. Since there are so many passionate users of the language, there are constant changes being made to what are considered industry standard tools. Once week there might be a cool and hot framework that everyone is talking about, and the next week it is obsolete. 

This can be seen as a fun opportunity to work your learning muscles, but it can be overwhelming for new programmers. Learning how to code with a language that is constantly evolving can be challenging for some. 

## My final thoughts

Despite not recommending Javascript to new developers who are learning to code, I still really like Javascript. You can use it for the front-end. You can use it for the back-end. It can do it all. Web development has rekindled my love for coding and motivates me to build new things. As a student with a few years of coding experience, I feel excited when I see how active the Javascript communities are. 

I am hoping that others who share the same enthusiasm go out and create amazing projects using that language. I will definitely be doing so!
